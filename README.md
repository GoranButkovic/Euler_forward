Forward Euler method applied to a conservative system like a simple harmonic oscillator will not show convergence because it is not a symplectic method.
Fixing this is done via the Semi-implicit Euler method which is a canonnical transformation (e.g. an symplectomorphism).

Forward Euler method can still be applied to non-conservative systems because there the change (loss) of energy is physical. 
$E = mc^2$
